[Conference](/2026/) | **Workshops** | [Call for Presentations](/2026/cfp) | [Sponsors](/2026/#sponsors) | [Team](/2026/#team)

We are excited to announce that we will be offering workshops at Elbsides 2026 on the day before the conference, on June 4th. We are currently looking for workshop proposals, so if you have an idea for a workshop, please contact us dirctly at elbsides \<at\> gmail.com.

Check back at this page for updates on the workshops that will be offered at Elbsides 2026. The location of the workshops
will not be the same as the conference, but it will be in Hamburg and easily accessible by public transportation.
The ticketing process will also be separate from the conference, so you will need to purchase a separate ticket for the workshops. We will provide more information on the ticketing process and the workshop schedule as we get closer to the conference date.
