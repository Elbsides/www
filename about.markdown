[Security BSides](http://securitybsides.com) events are organized by local computer security experts for the benefit of the local community. It is a way of bringing in speakers who may not ordinarily visit our community and it's a way of bringing the community together.

Elbsides is derived from the successful [HH.Security](https://www.meetup.com/hh-security/) Meetup and some of the organizers of [BSidesMunich](https://bsidesmunich.org). The first event in [2019](/2019/) was successful with 150 participants, several talks, workshops and the legendary [Paul Vixie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulvixie/) as keynote speaker.
