# Talks

## Opening

Speaker: [Morton Swimmer](#morton)

## 40 years Census Decision: The census and understanding privacy protection in the transition of time.

Speaker: [Simone Fischer-Hübner](#prof-dr-simone-fischer-hübner)

Slides: [PDF](/assets/2023/Simone - 40 Jahre VZ 2023-11-17.pdf)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfwdja5wUUQ?si=wBsDn-p97Ntb-l2L" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In 1983, the German Constitutional court stopped in its census decision the planned census, which according to the court was violating the individual right to informational self-determination. The court required a clear purpose limitation of census data as well as the requirement that census data must be (effectively) anonymized. While for the 1987 census, the German government and Census Bureau assumed that deleting directly identifying personal identifiers, such as name and address, would be sufficient for anonymisation, Klaus Brunnstein and Simone Fischer-Hübner demonstrated with a simple simulation model that a few additional personal data attributes would be sufficient to uniquely most individuals. 40 years later, the problem that it is basically impossible to anonymise personal data by simply suppressing some attributes is meanwhile very well understand. For effectively protecting statistical data, privacy-enhancing technologies, including k-anonymity and differential privacy, have been developed. Differential privacy has been used recently by the US census and is also used by tech giants, such as Apple, Google or Uber, for enhancing privacy for their data analyses - however, differential privacy provides privacy functionalities that are hard to convey to lay users and decision makers. This talk provides an overview of how the understanding of privacy, anonymity and privacy enhancing technologies for census and data analytics has developed over the last 40 years and discusses remaining challenges.


## My CI/CD pipeline contains all security tools available! Now what...?

Speaker: [Jasmin Mair](#jasmin-mair)

Slides: [PDF](/assets/2023/Jasmin - My CICD pipeline contains all security tools available! Now what.pdf)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dK3SW-_u2mM?si=4135QkRpDCIXGySL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In today's fast-paced environment, teams are under constant pressure to deliver code, features, and applications at an unprecedented speed, thanks to the contributions of Agile and DevOps methodologies. While these approaches have significantly accelerated the time to market, the downside is that rapid development often comes at the cost of neglecting critical security considerations, potentially leaving systems vulnerable to cyber threats and compromises.

But does DevSecOps, the seemingly ideal bridge between agility and security, truly live up to its promise, or is it too good to be true? The reality often reveals a substantial gap between theory and practice.

This talk will not only delve into the principles and potential of DevSecOps but will also shed light on a commonly overlooked challenge: teams' premature and excessive focus on acquiring security tools without executing proper implementation.
By exploring real-world examples and best practices, this talk aims to provide practical insights into addressing these challenges and fostering a cultural shift that can lead to successful DevSecOps adoption. It's not just about buying tools; it's about implementing them thoughtfully and collaboratively to fortify your development process against security threats.

## Secure Supply Chains, Secure Containers

Speaker: [Lukas Mika](#lukas-mika)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qq3yntUDTwc?si=Oez8N5gwZO0E7RC-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The invention of the container has created entirely new opportunities through the accompanying standardization - both in global trade and in software development. This has resulted in increasingly complex supply chains in logistics and software development, which need to be secured in both industries.

But how do companies address the associated risks and what lessons can we learn for our development processes?
How can they ensure that they know, what they ship in their containers?
How can security be embedded in their processes, without delaying their deliveries?

Using the Secure Software Development Lifecycle, this presentation will illustrate the strategic vision that the container shipping company Maersk uses to design its own software development process and to identify, mitigate and prevent security and operational risks along the software supply chain. It will take a closer look at the process, its objectives and the challenges it faces.

## A beginner's guide to SSO (mis)configuration

Speaker: [Adina Bogert-O'Brien](#adina-bogert-obrien)

Slides: [PDF](/assets/2023/Adina - SSO talk.pdf)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2KwrZPhi48?si=FptfIjVtlpsY-ae1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

SSO is sold as a way to
* centralize managing your organization's users,
* make life easier for your colleagues, and
* enforce consistent security standards.

But SSO protocols are just ways for an identity provider to share information about an authenticated identity with another service. Me having a way to tell my vendor "yeah, that's Bob" doesn't tell me what the vendor does with this information, or if the vendor always asks me who's coming in the door.

A bad SSO implementation can make you think you're safer, while hiding all the new and fun things that have gone wrong.

To get the most out of implementing SSO, I need to know what I'm trying to accomplish and what steps I need to follow to get there. To illustrate why SSO needs to be set up carefully, for each of the things you need to do right, I'll give you some fun examples of creative ways you and your vendor can do this wrong. We all learn from failure, right???

I'm sharing this info because this year I got deeply involved in the SSO setup for several vendors at work. It turns out that I'm good at asking weird questions, and it's an extremely valuable thing to do. If you know how things should be, then you know where they could be broken, and you can ask your vendors (and your colleagues!) "wierd questions" before an adversary does.

## You are (not) prepared - A ransomware story

Speaker: [Christian Kollee](#christian-kollee)

Slides: [PDF]("/assets/2023/Christian - You are not prepared.pdf")


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1aoLBDdKHg?si=X-ryrC8gHGQfZe3o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ransomware attacks are an ever-present menace for companies of all sizes. But they are especially devastating for small and medium-sized businesses. However, ransomware attacks typically consistently proceed similarly. The techniques used differ depending on the grouping and the infrastructure attacked.

Looking at the Incident Response cycle, many companies omit the first phase at least partially: preparation. On the one hand, the preparation phase includes preventive measures, i.e., measures to reduce the likelihood of an incident. On the other hand, since preventive measures can fail, companies must also implement steps for when an incident does occur. Missing these preparations will lead to problems and delays during an incident.

While responding to an incident, handling two different work streams is necessary. The first stream is the recovery of the company network. In the best case, the company can manage this stream independently. The second workstream is the forensics analysis of the incident. Usually, small and medium-sized businesses lack the necessary knowledge and require a specialized service provider. This stream is essential to understand how the attackers entered the environment, how they moved around, and what backdoors they placed that they could use to return. Forensic analysis is also required to decide which systems the company needs to replace, which they need to clean up, and which they can continue to use. The less precise the forensic results, the more conservative the rebuild has to be.

You can do a lot before an actual incident; some to make it less likely to get hit and some to make it easier to recover. There are also some recommendations to ensure that you handle the incident response as well as possible. In this talk, I'll
 - tell a story of an exemplary incident response based on what I saw during the last five years,
 - show general tips that reduce the likelihood of such an attack,
 - provide preparation steps to ease the response in case of an incident,
 - and give some hints on how to handle the response.


## Reverse Engineering of Intel’s Branch Prediction

Speaker: [Nick Mahling](#nick-mahling)

Slides: [PDF](/assets/2023/Nick - Reverse Engineering of Intel's Branch Prediction.pdf)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ArYCu3S-xRg?si=GaA-vwzC-hkmovbr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Due to the rise of cloud computing, many applications share hardware resources with other applications in the cloud. While cloud computing offers numerous advantages, it has also introduced new security threats that need to be addressed. To reduce these risks, virtualization is used to isolate applications. A CPU involves a vast array of microarchitectural components dedicated to multiple tasks. If any of these underlying components possess a design flaw, it could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, making the virtualization obsolete. One of these microarchitectural vulnerabilities is known as Spectre, which encompasses attacks capable of exploiting speculative execution to manipulate the control flow of an application. Speculative execution is a key feature in modern processors that leverages multiple microarchitectural elements to optimize runtime performance. This is achieved among other things by accurately predicting conditional branch outcomes. By analyzing the history of a branch, the processors can make guesses about the direction a program will take, enabling it to speculatively execute instructions ahead of time. Spectre variants targeting this mechanism have the ability to alter the program's execution path, potentially allowing an attacker to leak sensitive information. Due to limited knowledge about branch prediction on modern processors, some of those Spectre variants presented by researchers are impractical e.g. because of very long shellcodes. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of branch prediction can unveil more efficient defense mechanisms.

Hence, this presentation which is based on my recent bachelor's thesis will focus on reverse engineering the branch prediction on modern Intel CPUs. Through the design and implementation of experiments, we aim to gain deeper insights into branch predictors. Specifically, our objective is to find pairs of branches that can interfere with each other's predictions. This acquired knowledge builds the foundation for developing a more reliable and efficient out-of-place Spectre attack.
By employing the information from that research, we successfully construct an attack and demonstrate its practical implications. The findings underline the importance of understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities arising from branch prediction mechanisms in CPUs.


## Broadcom router SDK vulnerabilities - the uncomfortable reality of the IoT Linux kernel space

Speaker: [Attila Szasz](#attila-szasz)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsebzn6Pq1I?si=12qrfPoPfHBsIjL9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This research uncovers the CVE-2023-31070 vulnerability, a concerning issue within the IoT Linux kernel space, specifically affecting the Broadcom BCM47xx SDK. This vulnerability resides in the Efficient Multicast Forwarding (EMF) slab-out-of-bounds write, and it has significant implications for IoT device security. The Broadcom BCM47xx SDK serves as the reference implementation in numerous router models, making it a ubiquitous presence in the IoT landscape. In fact, the issue affects router devices from at least 14 manufacturers, and more than 50 popular models, therefore affecting a significant market share of small office home networking devices.

The EMF module, responsible for optimizing multicast traffic, is a crucial component, particularly in applications like IPTV.

Within this SDK, a critical flaw lurks in the EMF kernel driver, emf.ko, primarily used for IGMP snooping. Through careful analysis and reverse engineering, the vulnerable code within emf.ko is dissected, revealing how an attacker can manipulate kernel module data structures with specifically crafted data. The ultimate goal of this exploitation is to achieve kernel-mode code execution, posing a substantial security risk.

To illustrate the practical implications of CVE-2023-31070, a demonstration is provided, showcasing how an attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds access in the kernel space, eventually causing system crashes. This demonstration, conducted on an ASUS AC87U device, serves as a real-world example of the potential consequences of this vulnerability.

This research journey also sheds light on the complexity of addressing such vulnerabilities. Close collaboration with Broadcom was required to get a fix, however, they have no control over the security update process of their OEMs and customers. In many cases, the affected models are no longer supported, even though tens of thousands of samples are still operated on public networks. This case study underscores the need for effective coordination in addressing vulnerabilities within interconnected systems.

This presentation will provide an in-depth examination of CVE-2023-31070, offering valuable insights into the IoT security landscape and the imperative to secure our interconnected devices. The talk aims to foster a discussion within the security community and raise awareness of the challenges posed by vulnerabilities in IoT ecosystems.
