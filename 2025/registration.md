This year we offer two types of tickets:

**Supporter Ticket** for 300 € - if you value our conference and our contribution to the community please consider booking this ticket. It helps us to admit more community members. Each supporter ticket allows us to admit two extra attendees.

This ticket type is available from May 2nd, 10:00 am CEST

**Community Ticket** for 25 € - this can be booked by anybody, e.g. students and employees who don't get reimbursed.

This ticket will become available from May 5th, 10:00 am CEST.

You'll receive an invoice together with your ticket, so you can expense it.

Payments will be accepted by PayPal.

Food and beverages will be provided to all attendees and each ticket also includes the networking hour after the conference with drinks.

**For your ticket to the Elbsides 2025 conference, please register [here at pretix](https://pretix.eu/elbsides/elbsides2025/).**
