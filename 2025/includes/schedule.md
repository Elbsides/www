## Why Defensive Software Architecture is Important, or: How to Compromise a Payment Processor using Math

**Start time:** 10:00

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Max Maaß](#max-maaß)

**Abstract:**
People talk a lot about defensive software architecture, but does it really make a difference?

In this presentation, I give an example from a security audit we performed, in which a simple misuse of a cryptographic primitive led to the compromise of an entire customer service tool for a payment provider, which would have allowed us full administrative access to their backends.

By stepping through the architecture of the system from the highest level down to the exact vulnerable code, this example allows us to illustrate the advantages of defensive software architectures with multiple layers of security. By the end of the presentation, you will have a new appreciation for defensive software architectures. As a bonus, you will also have learned about a neat cryptographic trick that exploits unauthenticated encryption.

## Internet Message-Protection using Certificates and (not yet) Transformation

**Start time:** 10:30

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Lars Fischer](#lars-fischer)

**Abstract:**
The crucial stopping-gap of wide-spread secure communication over Email clearly seems to be "usability". The difficult part arguably is "certificate management" which, at the core is the question of how to authenticate credentials. Many researchers and developers have taken their shot at improving the situation, while instant messenger applications seem to simply circumvent all obstacles and provide effortless end-to-end security — alas only for communication within their respective silos. And the situation for Email, i.e. combination of SMTP (RFC 5321) and Internet Text Messages, going back to RFC 724 and RFC 772, nowadays encapsulated by MIME, is anything but simple. But since 2015 ACME seemed to have solved the similar problem of distributing authenticated certificates for web-sites. In this work we take up the work on ACME for end-users and transfer the principles to OpenPGP and thus finally solving(?) this problem from the 1990s.

## From Unrestricted Uploads to Security Nightmares: Preventing and Mitigating File Upload Vulnerabilities

**Start time:** 11:30

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Sewar Khalifeh](#sewar-khalifeh)

**Abstract:**
Unrestricted file uploads pose a significant threat to application security, allowing attackers to exploit various vulnerabilities and gain unauthorised access to systems and data. And there are some potential risks associated with unrestricted file uploads, such as: Triggering vulnerabilities in libraries/applications, abusing real-time security tools, executing malicious code and unauthorised access to sensitive files. In addition to the standard security best practices for file uploads, such as restricting file size, types, and extensions; experts recommends security controls to further enhance protection and validate files. These technologies include Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR), multi-AV scanning, sandboxing, and single-AV scanning. The aim of this presentation is to provide a detailed walkthrough of the risks and attacks associated with unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities, review the protective technologies available, outline proper mitigation strategies, and give practical examples on how to secure your environment against malicious uploads.

## AWS Advanced Offensive Techniques, what defenders need to know.

**Start time:** 12:00

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Santi Abastante](#santi-abastante)

**Abstract:**
In this technical, demo-driven session, we’ll explore the tactics and techniques attackers use to compromise infrastructures in Amazon Web Services (AWS), from initial access to achieving advanced persistence. Using known threat actor techniques in an adversary emulation approach, we’ll examine common attack vectors such as credential exploitation, privilege escalation, and lateral movement, along with advanced persistence methods that allow attackers to maintain control of compromised environments. Defensive and detection strategies will be highlighted, leveraging both AWS-native services and external tools, helping security teams strengthen their defenses. This session promises a practical, real-world experience for attendees.

## Breaking the CI/CD Chain: Security Risks in GitHub Actions

**Start time:** 12:30

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Igor Stepansky](#igor-stepansky)
- [Michael Goberman](#michael-goberman)

**Abstract:**
GitHub Actions have become a critical part of CI/CD pipelines, but do you really know what's happening under the hood?

This talk will break down GitHub Actions concepts, explore their security risks, and highlight how third-party actions in the supply chain can introduce vulnerabilities. We'll examine real-world examples of misconfigurations, critical security risks, and unexpected workflow behaviors that attackers can exploit.

We'll also discuss the recent security issue with tj-actions/changed-files, and we'll analyze how attackers can exploit these risks and what security best practices can help to mitigate them.

Additionally, we'll compare existing security tools, from static analysis scanners to runtime monitoring solutions, and discuss how teams can integrate them into their CI/CD pipelines. Finally, I'll introduce a new tool designed to help identify and analyze transitive actions, making it easier to assess their impact and reduce security risks.

Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of GitHub Actions' security landscape, real-world case studies, and practical techniques for proactively securing their workflows, alongside a new tool to simplify the process.

## SBOMs – A Tragicomedy in Three Acts

**Start time:** 14:15

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Jasmin Mair](#jasmin-mair)

**Abstract:**
Increasing supply chain attacks have highlighted the need for greater transparency in software. As a result, more regulations now require software vendors to provide SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials) for their products. In this talk, we’ll take you on a journey into the world of CISOs and managers who hope that SBOMs can solve many problems in the areas of cybersecurity and cyber resilience. Our brave architect will address questions such as: Do SBOMs actually make products more secure? Can they help mitigate situations like Log4Shell? What exactly do they need to contain? Along the way, they’ll debunk inflated expectations and outline the prerequisites for using SBOMs effectively.

## The Ongoing Challenge of Phishing: Examining Attack Vectors and Exploring Defense Improvements

**Start time:** 14:45

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Andrey Voitenko](#andrey-voitenko)

**Abstract:**
Phishing attacks are evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Despite significant investments in Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) and email security stacks, phishing remains one of the most effective initial access vectors. This session examines why phishing continues to succeed and introduces a practical, high-impact strategy to strengthen defenses.

SEGs typically rely on a layered architecture that includes header analysis, policy enforcement, static anti virus (AV) signature checks, link reputation services, and even lightweight sandboxing. As SEGs must process high volumes of email with minimal latency, they are optimized for speed and scale rather than for depth of inspection and comprehensive analysis. This can create exploitable detection blind spots. Sophisticated phishing campaigns take advantage of these limitations using tactics such as multi-stage redirect chains, geolocation- or time-based payload activation, QR codes, SVG images, and HTML smuggling

What can be done?

One often overlooked opportunity to address these advanced threats lies in integrating the organization’s User-Reported Phising (URP) program with advanced sandboxing technology. Unlike SEGs, these sandboxes operate outside real-time delivery constraints. They simulate realistic user interaction, follow complex redirect paths, and expose evasive payloads in a save analysis environment. This enables faster triage, higher-confidence verdicts, and improved detection of phishing threats that bypass gateway-level defenses.

This session will include real-world examples of advanced phishing techniques, such as redirect chains, QR code-based attacks, and SVG-based payloads, and show how advanced sandboxing can be used to detect them effectively.

## Effects and dynamics of Cybercrime on cyberprofessionals in the workfield. How can we optimize the workplace for our guards in Cybersecurity?

**Start time:** 15:15

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Sarah Pauli](#sarah-pauli)

**Abstract:**
I would like to give an insightful exploration into the impact of Cybercrime on the mental health of SOC-Analysts and related roles which are connected to the upper management. 
As we delve into this critical topic, we recognize the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks and decresing availability in the workforce. SOC´s are at the forefront of defending organizations against these threats, yet the demanding nature of their work often leads to significant stress and burnout among SOC analysts and upper management dedicated in the field of Cybersecurity. 

Most of the time, we try to reflect on the technical stability in this area. But we do not figure out how important structures and regulated processes are relevant in this area, similar to High-reliability organizations (e.g. Aviation or Medicine). 

I want to give an inspirational approach to improve the workplace, keeping professionals more resilient and longer in their workplace. My approach reflects not just on mental health and wellbeing, it´s partly a management calculation which should be added in the consideration of defending risks from organizations.

## HyTrack: Tracking You Across Apps and the Web Hydra-Style

**Start time:** 16:15

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Malte Wessels](#malte-wessels)

**Abstract:**
We found HyTrack, a robust new tracking Android tracking technique.
It allows tracking providers to track you across multiple apps and the web.
It does not depend on the ad IDs or fingerprinting and can be hidden from you.
HyTrack is based on a new browser feature called Custom Tabs.
Additionally, it is hard to get rid of: It might survive browser purges and the re-installation of affected apps.

In short, HyTrack brings the full power of web tracking to native Android and is a danger to user privacy as it allows tracking across apps and the web.

In this talk, we will discuss the mechanisms behind it, check which browsers and devices are affected, and discuss mitigations.
Finally, we will recommend the next steps for you and the community to take to mitigate HyTrack and protect user privacy.

## Pentest Pains

**Start time:** 16:45

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Chris Traynor](#chris-traynor)

**Abstract:**
Pentesting is meant to uncover security weaknesses, but sometimes the process itself becomes an exercise in frustration. From unclear scopes and unresponsive clients to network misconfigurations and unexpected legal roadblocks, every pentester has war stories of engagements gone wrong. This talk dives into real-world pentesting pain points, sharing firsthand experiences of what makes assessments more difficult than they need to be—and how to avoid these pitfalls.

Whether you’re a seasoned pentester, a blue teamer trying to prepare for a test, or a purple teamer bridging the gap, understanding these challenges can help ensure your next engagement is smoother and more effective. We’ll cover the most common mistakes from all sides of the table, such as poor scoping, lack of communication, ineffective remediation, and unrealistic expectations.

Beyond just the horror stories, this session provides actionable lessons to help security teams and consultants work together more efficiently. Learn how to avoid common traps, improve collaboration, and turn painful experiences into opportunities for a more productive outcome.

## Closing Keynote: Malware, Meet AI: Friend or Foe?

**Start time:** 17:15

**Duration:** 00:30

**Speaker(s):**
- [Axelle Apvrille](#axelle-apvrille)

**Abstract:**
Artificial Intelligence is capable of creating malware. Fortunately, it is also capable of analyzing them, summarizing and decompiling them with surprising clarity. But how much can we trust it?

In this keynote, we'll explore moments where AI shines and fails. We'll also discuss MCP security (Model Context Protocol): a modern protocol with no/little security? As AI and malware evolve together, what does the future hold, in terms of malware and anti-malware?
