For your ticket to the Elbsides 2024 conference please register with [pretix](https://pretix.eu/elbsides/elbsides2024/).

This year we offer two types of tickets: Supporter Ticket and Regular attendee ticket.

Regular tickets are EUR 25 and we keep this low to make the conference as inclusive as possible.

As a normal ticket does not cover the expenses for food and the conference space,
we also offer supporter tickets that allows delegates pay something towards our expenses.
You'll receive an invoice together with your ticket, so you can expense it.
Payments will be accepted by PayPal.

Food and beverages will be provided to all attendees and each ticket also includes the
Networking Hour after the conference with drinks.

Registration will open 29th of  July, 2024 at 11:00 CEST.

If you are a sponsor or speaker, please wait for your voucher to register.

If you have any further questions, contact us at **elbsides -at- gmail.com**.
