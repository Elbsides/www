Our Code of Conduct is based on the [BSidesMunich Code of Conduct](http://www.bsidesmunich.org/codeofconduct/) which in turn is based on thr [berlincodeofconduct.org ](https://berlincodeofconduct.org).

# Purpose and Scope #

The primary purpose of the Elbsides Code of Conduct is to provide the foundation for the inclusion of a diverse range of contributors and participants so that we can focus on exchanging ideas about security. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, academic background and religion (or lack thereof).

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

# Expected Behavior #

Participate! The conference goes from good to excellent when you actively engage with the people in the community and the conference subject matter. Think about how your speech and actions may affect others around you and exercise consideration and respect.

We expect a healthy amount of scrutiny of conference subject matter. But, in cases of disagreement, attempt collaboration before conflict.

Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

# Unacceptable Behavior #

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; harassment of these patrons of these venues is also unacceptable.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

In addition, the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the conference premises during the conference day from the starting times in the mornings to the end times in the evening is prohibited.

# Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior #

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the event without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

# If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior #

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of the event organizers, or send an email to [email address available during conference] which will be monitored during the course of the conference.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

# Addressing Grievances #

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the event organizers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be reviewed by an independent third party.
