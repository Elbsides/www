Morton is a manager in the Forward-Looking Threat Research (FTR) team at Trend Micro, Inc. where he peers into the future of computers and society to identify the risks and vulnerabilities of the future. His past in computer security stretches back 30 years and he has been involved in most of the innovations in security, first at the University of Hamburg, Germany, then IBM Research and now Trend Micro. While originally active in malware analysis and computer forensics, recently his team has been focussing on massive threat data analysis for spotting new types of attacks quantitatively and also on modelling future threats to society that will accompany its inevitable march towards tighter integration in smart cities, intelligent transportation, supply chains and manufacturing. Morton, a native of New York City, has a Computer Science PhD degree from the University of Hamburg, and currently resides in the Hamburg, Germany area.

Coming from a non-technical background, Dagmar brings her knowledge of event organization to Elbsides. Through previous experiences in professional stage management / production for theatre in the UK and US, as well as Sci-Fi conventions in Germany, she teamed up with her husband Morton to organize events for the computer security industry, Bsides Munich being among them. Having lived and worked in a variety of countries, she enjoys traveling the globe and going to the theater, which hopefully will be possible again soon.

Hendrik  is a security engineer by day, and a security aficionado by night. His professional focus is on application security, digital fire fighting, and talking about risk (management).
After work he is wrapping his head around the fascinating inner lives of ELFs and ARMs.


## Stefan ##

For all his professional business life (even years before that) Stefan has been involved in information security. In 1993 he was the first student to be hired by the freshly launched [DFN-CERT Services GmbH](https://www.dfn-cert.de/), the first Computer Emergency Response Team in Germany and also one of the first within Europe. After having spent a number of years in the PKI universe he worked as an IT security consultant for the next 15 years before re-joining the awesome crew at [DFN-CERT Services GmbH](https://www.dfn-cert.de/) in 2016. He likes IT forensics, Cyber Threat Intelligence, and malware analysis and loves helping people.

## Florian ##

A past interest in archeology brought Florian to the field of security. To him, both share a similar approach: recognizing the ideas of the past via its artifacts and the application of these lessons to form a better future. As a security engineer he tries to adopt this philosophy to the various fields of the field, may it be user awareness, os and network security or how to cloud securely. He also enjoys spicy food, fast bikes and open source.

## Ingo ##

Ingo works on all things related to information security. Compliance, user security, application security, opsec. He prefers automated, technical solutions and good awareness over a checklist approach to infosec. He is passionate about security. If compliance helps him to get there, that's fine. Ingo enjoys working in a team and in an environment that puts people and trust first. He is also the organizer of the [HH.security](https://www.meetup.com/hh-security/) meetup. In his spare time, Ingo enjoys modern boardgames.

## Deborah ##

Deborah is another non-techie at Elbsides. With her profession in sales and marketing for an IT security company since 2019, she joined Elbsides - her very first IT security conference. To understand the IT security world better, diving deeper into the topic, getting to know the community and expanding her horizon became essential to her. If she does not write offers for IT security assessments and volunteer for Elbsides, doggie Pete will grab parts of her attention.

## David ##

David is a self-employed software developer, penetration tester and IT consultant. While being fascinated by computer security since his teenage years, most of his career revolved around building and maintaining software. In recent years, however, David's interest in offensive security led him to not only build systems but also break (into) them doing pentesting engagements.

## Jonas ##

Jonas' day job is in security testing, incident response and forensics at [Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH](https://www.t-systems.com/de/de/security). During engagements he specializes in disk forensics and fast triage, relying heavily on automation to aid in fast recovery of customers affected by data breaches or malware incidents.
In his spare screen time he engages in various open source efforts and likes researching new forensics related topics. Reverse engineering proprietary APIs, file formats and protocols is one of his main interests.

## Fabian ##

Fabian started his career in financial consulting before his passion for microelectronics and cyber security lead him back to school to get his masters degree in micro electronic systems. He now looks into hardware vulnerabilities in embedded systems whenever he isn't making music.
