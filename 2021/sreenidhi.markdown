# Abstract

In an era of Spams and Hams, we need to keep an eye out for document attachments in emails. Malwares today heavily operate using e-mail attachments as a means to enter a victim’s system. It’s a stroll in the park to spot plain malicious code in a document but what if it is obfuscated . Well, the level of obfuscation equals the time spent to decode that portion in a document. Obfuscation holds the key in today’s threat landscape and also level of obfuscation matters too. In this talk we will take a look at some of the peek-a-boos that malware authors play with us and also some end game level obfuscation techniques.
