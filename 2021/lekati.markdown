# Abstract

What does it take from a cybersecurity professional to be heard in their organization and spread their message about the importance of cybersecurity to both the leadership and the other employees? And if that wasn’t already hard enough, what does it take to lead behavior change and build a cybersecurity culture? It has became clear that technical cybersecurity measures need to operate in harmony with, and be applied from people. Today’s employees need to practice good cyber security habits to protect the assets they handle, and their organization.
