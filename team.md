Morton is a manager in the Forward-Looking Threat Research (FTR) team at Trend Micro, Inc. where he peers into the future of computers and society to identify the risks and vulnerabilities of the future. His past in computer security stretches back 30 years and he has been involved in most of the innovations in security, first at the University of Hamburg, Germany, then IBM Research and now Trend Micro. While originally active in malware analysis and computer forensics, recently his team has been focussing on massive threat data analysis for spotting new types of attacks quantitatively and also on modelling future threats to society that will accompany its inevitable march towards tighter integration in smart cities, intelligent transportation, supply chains and manufacturing. Morton, a native of New York City, has a Computer Science PhD degree from the University of Hamburg, and currently resides in the Hamburg, Germany area.

A past interest in archeology brought Florian to the field of security. To him, both share a similar approach: recognizing the ideas of the past via its artefacts and the application of these lessons to form a better future. As a security engineer he tries to adopt this philosophy to the various fields of the field, may it be user awareness, os and network security or how to cloud securely. He also enjoys hot food, fast bikes and open source.
